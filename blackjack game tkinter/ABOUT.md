# BlackJack in Python ##
This repository contains my Blackjack game. It's made in Python using Zelle's graphics.py. which is wrapper around tkinter

>Extends the "card" class created using a method draw (self, win, center) that shows the map in a graphical window. Use this more extensive class to pull two cards randomly from a stick (of the 52 cards, so we play in contrast to the casino but with one deck at a time) and show these cards on the screen, with the total Blackjack value.

### Winning conditions ###
>Then the user can always choose "pass" or "draw" (make two buttons for this). If you fit you can earn dollars:
><ul>
><li>21: 20000 dollars</li>
><li>20: 10000 dollars</li>
><li>19: 5000 dollars</li>
><li>18: 2500 dollars</li>
></ul>
>If the total Blackjack value exceeds 21, you lose 10000 dollars and start a new game.
>On the screen, always see what the total score in dollars so far is.
>Also, provide a "quit" button that lets you stop.
